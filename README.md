## Step 2: Install Software

### Step 2.1: Install Python
To get started, you first need [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you already have Python, you can move on to the next step.

Double-check that Python and pip are installed by running `python3 --version` and `pip --version`in your CLI.\
**(use `python` if `python3` doesn't work)**

It should tell you the respective version numbers in the form of `Python 3.x.x` and `pip 23.x.x`

**FOR WINDOWS DEVICES:** If the above fails, try the following:

- add to system env variables

### Step 2.2: Create Environment
Open the code in your IDE of choice. If you don't have one already, you can install a free one [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Open up the CLI and enter the command:

`pip install virtualenv`

cd into your project folder and run

`virtualenv venv`

You should see that a folder named `venv` has been created.

**Mac / Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`\
**Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

Once the venv has been activated, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of the path. You can now install the required modules using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can do a final check with `pip list` to see that all the modules have been installed correctly.
