# Personal Companion Discord Bot

## Presented by GDSC - Google Developer Student Club

ü§ñ Introduction to Discord Bot Development ü§ñ

Welcome to the GDSC Personal Companion Discord Bot Event! We are thrilled to have you here for an exciting journey into the world of AI-powered Discord bots! This event is all about creating your very own personal companion bot, which will be your loyal virtual friend on Discord. Whether you prefer to work individually or in groups, this event offers a fantastic opportunity to learn, collaborate, and build something truly awesome!

üöÄ What to Expect üöÄ

During this session, you will gain hands-on experience in building an AI-driven Discord bot using the power of OpenAI API and the Discord API. Our talented mentors and organizers are ready to guide you every step of the way, providing you with valuable insights into bot development, AI integration, and creative custom features.

üéØ Learning Objectives üéØ

By the end of the event, you will:

Master the basics of Discord bot development.
Harness the potential of OpenAI API to imbue your bot with AI capabilities.
Utilize the Discord API to seamlessly integrate your bot into Discord servers.
Understand how to expand your bot's functionalities with custom commands and interactions with other APIs.

Happy coding! üöÄü§ñ

## Step 1: Clone The Repository

Download the code by clicking the green `Code` button and then `Download ZIP`

## Step 2: Install Software

### Step 2.1: Install Python

To get started, you first need [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you already have Python, you can move on to the next step.

Double-check that Python and pip are installed by running `python3 --version` and `pip --version`in your CLI.\
**(use `python` if `python3` doesn't work)**

It should output `Python 3.x.x` and `pip 23.x.x`

**FOR WINDOWS DEVICES:** If the above fails, try the following:

# ‚ùó‚ùóTODO:

- Find your Python path (where Python was just installed on your computer, note that it may be different from the image below)

- Search for "Edit the system environment variables" in Windows search, and add the path that you found previously to the `PATH` variable. See below.

### Step 2.2: Create Environment

Open the code in your IDE of choice. If you don't have one already, you can install a free one [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Open up the CLI and enter the command:

`pip install virtualenv`

`cd` into your project folder and run

`python3 -m virtualenv venv`

You should see that a folder named `venv` has been created.

You can now activate the virtual environment using the following command.

**Mac / Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`\
**Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

Once the venv has been activated, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of the path. You can now install the required modules with

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can do a final check with `pip list` to see that all the modules have been installed correctly.

## Step 3: Configuration Setup

Rename the `example.env` file in the root directory to `.env`. You will notice it has been prepopulated with the following information.

```.env
TOKEN=<YourBotToken>
API_KEY=<YourAPIKey>
BOT_ID=<YourBotId>
```

The env file stores all your application secrets. You will be filing this out with the appropriate values in the following steps:

### Step 3.1: Discord Bot setup

To create and configure a Discord bot, head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Once logged in, click `New Application` in the top left corner.

Enter the details and then enter into the application.

On `General Information` tab, there is an option to `copy` the application id. Copy this and replace `<YourBotId>` with it in the `.env` file.

Click on the `Bot` tab on the left, where you can set the name and icon of your bot. Here is also where you can find the Bot Token. If you don't see one, you may need to generate a new token with `reset`.

Once you have your token, replace `<YourBotToken>` with it in the `.env` file.

On the same `Bot` tab, scroll down and enable all **Privileged Gateway Intents**

Click on `URL Generator` under the `OAuth2` tab.

Enable the `bot` and `applications.commands` **scopes**

<img width="800px" src="./images/scopes.jpeg">

Enable `Send Messages` under **Bot Permissions**, and any other permissions you wish to grant your bot.

You can now copy and paste the generated URL into your Discord server. Click on the link to authorize the bot.

### Step 3.2: OpenAi Api key

The OpenAI API key is crucial to infuse your Discord bot with AI capabilities provided by OpenAI.
Here's how to obtain and set up your API key:

Obtain your OpenAi Api key:

- Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)
- Sign up or log into your account
- Once logged in, click Personal (at the top right corner of the page) and then click View API keys
- Click "+ Create new secret key" to generate a new API key if you haven't already. Keep this key secure and do not share it publicly.

Integrate the key into your project:

- Inside the `.env` file, replace `<YourAPIKey>` with the API key you obtained from the OpenAI platform.

## Step 4: Run

Run with `python3 src` in the root directory

## Step 5: Extra for Experts

- Custom commands
  - Go beyond the basics and experiment with creating more advanced custom commands. Learn to handle parameters, aliases, and complex formatting to give your bot a unique edge.
- Explore OpenAI
  - Delve into OpenAI's features. Adjust parameters like temperature and max tokens to fine-tune your bot's responses for different contexts, adding depth to your bot's interactions.
  - Temperature: a parameter that determines the randomness of the model's output.
    - For example, a high temperature (e.g 0.8) will be beneficial when a creative response is needed, however there is a higher chance that the output will be nonsensical. A low temperature (e.g. 0.2) will stick to the most probable output and is good for straightforward tasks where a consistent answer is needed.
  - Max tokens: a parameter that sets the limit on the number of token's in the model's output.
    - For example, a short output (e.g max 40 tokens) can be used if you are wanting short answers or are looking for concise information. A long output (e.g. max 500 tokens) can be used for a more detailed answer.
  - When using these parameters, you can adjust them to fit your application and it is a good idea to test various settings to see which one works best.
- Read up on the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) to learn more about the features and intricacies of Python discord bots.

These suggestions offer participants a chance to deepen their understanding of bot customization and OpenAI's capabilities. Happy coding! üöÄü§ñ
